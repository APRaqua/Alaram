As we all know, nowadays wake up on time is a very difficult task. The solution is the Alarm Clock. In this project, we will learn, How to create an Alarm Clock using Tkinter in Python. Without alarms, several people would oversleep and land up late for work. Alarm clocks may also be useful for keeping sleep schedules regular.

PYTHON MODULES FOR PROJECT

1.Tkinter module: Python offers multiple choices for developing a GUI (Graphical User Interface). Out of all the GUI strategies, tkinter is that the most ordinarily used technique. It’s a customary Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit shipped with Python.


2. sys module: sys module in Python provides various functions and variables that are used to manipulate different parts of the Python runtime environment. It allows operating on the interpreter as it provides access to the variables and functions that interact strongly with the interpreter. 

3.Datetime module: Python Datetime module supplies classes to work with date and time. These classes provide a number of functions to deal with dates, times, and time intervals. Date and DateTime are an object in Python, so when you manipulate them, you are actually manipulating objects and not strings or timestamps.
The DateTime module is categorized into 6 main classes – 
•	date
•	time
•	datetime
•	timedelta
•	tzinfo
•	timezone



4.time module: As the name suggests Python time module allows to work with time in Python. It allows functionality like getting the current time, pausing the Program from executing.

5.pygame module: Pygame is a cross-platform set of Python modules which is used to create video games.It consists of computer graphics and sound libraries designed to be used with the Python programming language. Pygame is suitable to create client-side applications that can be potentially wrapped in a standalone executable.

6.threading module: The threading module exposes all the methods of the thread module and provides some additional methods 


Tkinter	pip  install tkinter

Pygame	pip  install pygame

Threading	pip  install threading

Datetime	pip  install datetime



Implementation steps

•	Make Infinite Loop

•	Get hours, minutes, seconds value from the user

•	Wait for one second using time module

•	Get Current time using datetime module

•	Check if the current time is equal to set time; play sound using pygame module.
